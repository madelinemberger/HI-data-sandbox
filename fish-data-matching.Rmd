# Summary 

Here I am simply matching fish data from the HIMARC database to their common names, which comes from NOAA data. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)


# read in data sets and clean it up

himarc <- read_csv(here("data/spp_ferl.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(1:24)

noaa_df <- read_csv(here("data/LIST_OF_FISH_SPECIES_04-21-2020.csv")) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(species_code = species, taxon = taxonname) %>% 
  select(1:11)


# join them together

himarc_commonnames <- left_join(himarc,noaa_df, by = "species_code")

himarc_taxonnames <- left_join(himarc,noaa_df, by = "taxon")


resource_fish <- himarc_commonnames %>% 
  filter(resource_species == TRUE)

resource_fish_na <- resource_fish %>% 
  filter(is.na(commonname))


# out of 129 species, 36 did not have matches in NOAAs database

# what if we use taxon name instead? 

himarc_taxonnames <- left_join(himarc,noaa_df, by = "taxon")

resource_fish2 <- himarc_taxonnames %>% 
  filter(resource_species == TRUE)

resource_fish_na2 <- resource_fish2 %>% 
  filter(is.na(commonname))


# out of 129 matched species, 26 do not have matches
# 15 have a species name, the rest do not

resource_fish_common <- resource_fish2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(commonname)) %>%
  select(taxon,commonname)

write_csv(resource_fish_common,
          here("outputs/resource_fish_commonames.csv"))

write_csv(resource_fish_na2,
          here("outputs/resource_fish_na.csv"))

print(resource_fish_common)
```
